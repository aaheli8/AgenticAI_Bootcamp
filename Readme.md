## Agentic AI Bootcamp

Setting up envroemnt with:
1. Creating Virtual Environment with Conda
2. Creating virtual Environment with UV Package Manager. 

- **What is Agentic AI?**
> AI systems that act with autonomy and initiative to achieve goals, making decisions and taking actions independently.

- Pydantic
> It is used for data validation getting from sources like APIs, LLMs. 

- **Langchain**
> LangChain is an open-source framework used for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the process of integrating LLMs with various data sources, tools, and services, making it easier to develop sophisticated applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, and more. 

### **Vector Databases**

>A vector database is a collection of data stored as mathematical representations. Vector databases make it easier for machine learning models to remember previous inputs, allowing machine learning to be used to power search, recommendations, and text generation use-cases.

### **RAG**
>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.
